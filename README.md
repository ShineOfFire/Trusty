### The project :

This project is a participatory chrome extension, which allows you to make the most of surf web.

You can help if you want with this base.

### What will be the extension?

It will allow anyone to know if a site is on or off via votes in the pop-up extension.

### Why this idea?

In fact sometimes I'm on some site and I'm wasting my time looking for whether the site is reliable or not whether it puts real information or not. I want to remedy this!
